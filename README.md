# TO DO

* Influence line for a unit load
* 3D truss

# Known Issue
* Program works fine. Just two bugs in Report.
* Constrained global stiffness matrix is not removing constrained rows in Report.
* Force matrix shows wrong degrees of freedom in Report. Those dofs should be incremented by 1.
* Support nodes value greater than 10 is not reading correctly when opened from saved files.

These will be patched in the next update.
