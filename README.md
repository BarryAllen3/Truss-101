# Truss 101
A desktop application to solve statically determinate and indeterminate 2D truss structures using Matrix Displacement Method (aka Finite Element Method).

## Where to download?
Click [Download](https://github.com/MShawon/Truss-101/releases/download/1.0.2/Truss.101_win_Setup_v1.0.2.exe) to get the latest version.

Or go to [Releases](https://github.com/MShawon/Truss-101/releases) and download file named with setup.

## Why Truss 101?
* Easy to use
* Unit conversion
* Stability check
* Individual property for members
* Multiple projects
* Report containing input-output data, matrices and graphs

# TO DO

* Influence line for a unit load
* 3D truss

# Known Issue
* Program works fine. Just two bugs in Report.
* Constrained global stiffness matrix is not removing constrained rows in Report.
* Force matrix shows wrong degrees of freedom in Report. Those dofs should be incremented by 1.
* Support nodes value greater than 10 is not reading correctly when opened from saved files.

These will be patched in the next update.
